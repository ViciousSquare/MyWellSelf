Design and develop an AI-powered health and wellness app, “My Well Self,” focused on maximizing user engagement, health outcomes, and HSA (Health Spending Account) optimization. The app should leverage a conversational survey, personalized analytics, actionable recommendations, financial integration, and employer-facing analytics. Below is a detailed prompt to guide development on an AI app platform like Replit.

Core Features
1. Conversational Wellness Assessment

Implement a chatbot (“Abby”) to guide users through a dynamic wellness survey.

Start with foundational questions on diet, weight, alcohol/drug use, physical activity, sleep, stress, mental and emotional health, and self-care.

Use 5-point Likert scale answers (from “Excellent” to “Not good at all”).

Dynamically add follow-up questions for low-scoring areas (e.g., “What stressors keep you up at night?” or “Do you use screens before bed?”).

Include questions on HSA literacy, usage barriers, financial health, medical history, current medications, health goals, technology access, and behavioral drivers.

2. Personalized Recommendations & Action Plans

After the survey, generate a personalized wellness score with a visual dashboard (e.g., radar chart or progress bars for each health domain).

Offer immediate, actionable tips for improvement in weak areas (e.g., “Try mindfulness apps for stress management”).

Curate and link to relevant articles, videos, and tools.

Suggest specific HSA-eligible services/products tailored to user needs (e.g., therapy, fitness classes, nutritionist, digital therapeutics).

Build a 4-week action plan with milestones and HSA-eligible options.

3. HSA Optimization & Financial Tools

Calculate and display estimated unused HSA funds.

Recommend optimal allocation of HSA funds for upcoming health goals.

Provide a budget planner for HSA spending (e.g., “Set aside $500 for stress management programs”).

Educate users on maximizing HSA benefits, contribution limits, and tax advantages.

Compare costs of preventive care vs. long-term health savings.

Offer a “Smart HSA Score” ranking spending categories by ROI (preventive care, chronic-disease management, mental health support).

4. Claims & Coverage Assistance

Guide users through HSA claims workflows, including receipt upload (OCR), auto-filling forms, and predicting out-of-pocket expenses.

Integrate with insurer APIs for expedited claims processing and real-time claim status updates.

Provide a virtual medicine cabinet to track drug costs, suggest generics, and flag upcoming refills.

5. Dynamic Wellness Dashboard

Visualize wellness scores and financial health using charts and progress bars.

Allow users to track trends over time, retake quizzes, and compare results.

Highlight improvements, regressions, and opportunities for HSA optimization.

6. Engagement & Gamification

Offer badges for completed goals and healthy behaviors (e.g., “Sleep Champion”).

Create 30-day challenges with HSA-funded rewards.

Send reminders and seasonal tips (e.g., “Try winter fitness programs covered by HSA”).

7. Tech Integrations

Sync with wearables (Fitbit, Apple Health) to auto-populate activity and sleep metrics.

Enable Abby to answer user-initiated questions about HSA coverage, eligible expenses, and services.

8. Marketplace & Partner Ecosystem

Integrate a marketplace of HSA-eligible providers (telehealth, gyms, nutritionists) with exclusive offers.

Enable direct booking and payment for services using HSA funds.

9. Proactive Follow-Ups

Send automated emails/notifications to check on user progress, remind about goals, or prompt quiz retakes.

Escalate to a human health advisor when needed.

10. Security & Trust

Highlight HIPAA compliance, data encryption, and privacy practices.

Display testimonials or user stories (mock-ups) showing improved health and HSA savings.

Employer/Advisor Analytics (B2B Focus)
Aggregate anonymized workforce health and HSA utilization data.

Show cost savings, risk-area heatmaps, and engagement trends.

Allow advisors to view member profiles, chat transcripts, and recommended action plans for efficient follow-up.

Example User Flow
Onboarding: Abby welcomes the user, explains the process, and starts the wellness survey.

Survey: User answers core and dynamic follow-up questions.

Results: User receives a personalized wellness score, visual dashboard, and specific recommendations.

Action Plan: User sees a tailored 4-week plan and HSA-eligible service suggestions.

Financial Tools: User views HSA balance, spending suggestions, and claim assistance.

Engagement: User participates in challenges, tracks progress, and receives reminders.

Marketplace: User books services directly and pays with HSA funds.

Follow-Up: Abby checks in periodically, offers new tips, and updates the action plan.

Example Questions to Include
“How would you rate your eating habits these days?”

“How do you manage your weight?”

“How often do you feel overwhelmed at work?”

“Do you use screens within an hour of bedtime?”

“Are you aware of your HSA balance and coverage?”

“Do you have any chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension)?”

“What are your top priorities for your HSA funds?”

“What obstacles have prevented you from using your HSA fully?”

“Do you use any wearable devices or health apps?”

“How comfortable are you with mobile apps and online portals?”

Technical Considerations
Use a modular, API-driven architecture for easy integration with third-party services (wearables, insurers, HSA providers).

Ensure scalability, security, and accessibility (multilingual support, voice-to-text, adjustable fonts).

Prioritize a modern, mobile-first UI/UX.

Prototype Demo Ideas
Mock dashboard with sample wellness score and “Improve Sleep” recommendations.

Sample 4-week action plan using HSA-eligible services.

Video walkthrough showing employer dashboard and cost-saving analytics.

Goal:
Build a prototype that demonstrates immediate user value (personalized insights), long-term engagement (tracking, gamification), and financial empowerment (HSA optimization), positioning My Well Self as a transformative tool for both individual users and enterprise clients.
